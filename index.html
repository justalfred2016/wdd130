        <p>Dumelang! my name is Shimani Alfred Tlokotsi, but I prefer Alfred. I'm from sunny South Africa and have a
            passion for learning
            new things, exploring, and playing chess. I also love making people happy and spreading positivity wherever
            I go.
            I'm always curious about the world and enjoy discovering new ideas, cultures, and experiences. Chess
            challenges me to
            think strategically, and I love the thrill of a good match. Whether it's through knowledge, kindness, or
            fun, I aim to
            make a positive impact on those around me. </p>
